### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Karl!

I'm a Cloud Architect and Engineer by day and programmer by night. I specialize in AWS, and I *love* to share my knowledge with others, which is why I help organize Meetup Groups such as [Bergen Cloud User Group](https://github.com/bergen-cloud-user-group) and others!

I have a passion for Open Source, which is why most things I do are released under the MIT license so that anyone can benefit from the work I'm doing.

If you are interested in AWS - please! Do reach out! I love to chat ðŸ’¬ and help those involved in it, and you're not an exception! ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on the #100DaysOfCloud project, where I spend time each day learning new things about the cloud. It's super exciting, and you can follow my journey on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cloudkarl) or here on [GitHub](https://github.com/kmoberg/100-Days-Of-Cloud). I'm working towards building more serverless solutions so that I can help guide companies becoming cloud-native.
